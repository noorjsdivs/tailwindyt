              I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote
              my first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks after my
              mom brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I taught
              myself to type on.

              The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space.
              When I was 8, I climbed the 40-foot oak tree at the back of our
              yard while wearing my older sister’s motorcycle helmet, counted
              down from three, and jumped — hoping the tree was tall enough that
              with just a bit of momentum I’d be able to get to orbit.
            </p>
            <p>
              I spent the next few summers indoors working on a rocket design,
              while I recovered from the multiple surgeries it took to fix my
              badly broken legs. It took nine iterations, but when I was 15 I
              sent my dad’s Blackberry into orbit and was able to transmit a
              photo back down to our family computer from space.
            </p>

              Today, I’m the founder of Planetaria, where we’re working on
              civilian space suits and manned shuttle kits you can assemble at
              home so that the next generation of kids really <em>can</em> make
              it to orbit — from the comfort of their own backyards.
